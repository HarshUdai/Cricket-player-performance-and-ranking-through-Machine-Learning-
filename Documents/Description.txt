                                    Machine learning – Project Description
                                “Cricket match analysis and score prediction”
                                    
Machine learning is very helpful in getting the possible outcomes of the event happening, 
with it past data or past experience. Following the basic idea of machine learning we are going to predict the score of a team, 
while it is playing i.e. if a team is playing and the over is 6, out model will predict how much that team will score after the innings. 
For this we are seeing the previous data of that player or team. And the factors through which we will try to predict the score are- ongoing
 over, run rate, total score of that player playing(based on previous data, location, opposition team. Through these factor our model will 
 analyze the complete game scenario and output how much a team will score.
After these analysis, model will also find the best players of the match and will result according to the previous data. 
Therefore  from this model we will get how much a team will score after certain overs of the innings and which team will win, 
and the best players of the complete game, with detailed analysis.
